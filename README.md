# buscor-online-ticket-booking-system
Developed a dynamic bus ticket booking website with Node.js, Express.js, HTML/CSS, and SQLite, integrating PayFast API for secure online payments. Built separate admin and client interfaces: Admin manages buses, routes, schedules, and bookings, while clients search and book tickets with real-time availability.
